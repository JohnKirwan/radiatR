# radiatR

radiatR is an R package that provides a toolkit for working with movement trajectories, particularly those with circular or angular support. It is designed to import, summarise, analyze, and visualise large numbers of movement tracksâ€”especially suited for behavioural experiments involving movement from or around a central origin, such as radial mazes or arena-based trials.

## Overview

This package comprises tools to import, summarise, and visualise movement trajectories with circular support. The aim is to have a convenient package to plot and explore many trajectories of angular data with ease and flexibility.

## Key Features

- Import and normalize tracking data from multi-trial experiments
- Extract circular trial boundaries and metadata from paired landmark/track files
- Transform Cartesian coordinates into circular coordinates (centering/scaling on a per-trial basis)
- Compute high-level circular statistics (mean direction, resultant length, concentration, etc.)
- Flexible visualization of tracks and summary statistics with high-quality ggplot2 layers
- Support for faceting and group overlays

## Core Modules

**1. Circular Trials (`R/circular_trials.R`)**
- Extract per-trial time bounds, arena origin, and stimulus angle from input data
- Transform and standardize position data for all trials and combine across multiple files
- Functions: `get_trial_limits`, `get_tracked_object_pos`, `get_all_object_pos`

**2. Circular Statistics (`R/circular_statistics.R`)**
- Compute summary statistics for angular data (leveraging the `circular` package)
- Provide group-wise or global summaries (means, concentration, resultant length, more)
- Main function: `circ_summary`

**3. Circular Plotting (`R/circular_plotting.R`)**
- Visualize trajectories and circular statistics using ggplot2
- Add concentric guides, direction ticks, mean resultant arrows, and custom radial overlays
- Main function: `radiate`

## Typical Workflow

1. **Import Data:** Use helper functions to load track and landmark files per trial or video.
2. **Extract and Transform:** Call `get_trial_limits` and `get_tracked_object_pos` to extract, normalize, and convert positions to circular form.
3. **Aggregate Across Files:** For large experiments, use `get_all_object_pos` to combine and standardize data from many sources.
4. **Summarize:** Calculate circular summary statistics (e.g., per trial, per group) using `circ_summary`.
5. **Visualize:** Create and customize high-quality circular plots of tracks and statistics using `radiate` and plot helpers from the package.

## Dependencies

radiatR depends on the following R packages (these will be installed automatically by R when you use the standard installation methods):

- ggplot2
- tibble
- purrr
- circular
- rlang
- methods
- utils
- stats

### Optional and Suggested Packages
- **ggrepel** (for improved label placement on plots; recommended but optional)
- **testthat**, **knitr**, **rmarkdown** (for testing and documentation)
- Additional suggested: arrow, data.table, jsonlite, readr, yaml, withr

To use all features (e.g., non-overlapping labels), install ggrepel:

```r
install.packages("ggrepel")
```

## Installation

### Install from Local Source
If you have downloaded or cloned this repository, you can install the package in R with:

```r
# In the repository directory:
devtools::install_local(path = ".")
# or
remotes::install_local(path = ".")
```

## Example

```r
library(radiatR)

# generate a reproducible demo data set
tracks <- simulate_tracks(n_trials = 3, n_points = 150, seed = 42)

# draw the tracks with concentric guides
radiate(tracks, x_col = "rel_x", y_col = "rel_y", group_col = "trial_id")
```
