\title{Aggregate track positions across all videos in a manifest.}
\usage{
get_all_object_pos(landmarks = NULL, animal_track = NULL, file_tbl, track_dir)
}
\arguments{
\item{landmarks}{Optional data frame or `TrajSet` for the first entry. Retained
for backwards compatibility; values are overwritten internally.}

\item{animal_track}{Optional data frame or `TrajSet` for the first entry.}

\item{file_tbl}{Tibble produced by [import_tracks()], optionally enriched via
[load_tracks()] or [load_tracks2()].}

\item{track_dir}{Directory containing the landmark and track text files.}
}
\value{
A `TrajSet` combining the normalised observations for all valid
  trials in the manifest. The aggregated trial limits are available via
  `meta$trial_limits`.
}
\description{
Iterates over the rows of `file_tbl`, reading the paired landmark and track
files for each video before computing trial limits and normalised
coordinates. The per-trial outputs are combined into a single tibble, and
the augmented trial limits are returned alongside it.
