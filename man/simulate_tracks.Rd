\title{Simulate radial tracks with controlled tortuosity.}
\usage{
simulate_tracks(
  n_trials = 6,
  n_points = 200,
  tortuosity_levels = c("low", "medium", "high"),
  seed = 123
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_trials}{Number of independent trials to simulate.}

\item{n_points}{Number of frames (rows) per trial.}

\item{tortuosity_levels}{Character vector of tortuosity labels; recycled over
`n_trials`. Valid values are `"low"`, `"medium"`, and `"high"`.}

\item{seed}{Seed passed to [set.seed()] to ensure reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns describing the simulated tracks, including:
  `trial_id`, `trial_num`, `frame`, `tortuosity`, `stim_theta`, `rho`,
  `abs_theta`, `rel_theta`, `rel_x`, `rel_y`, `abs_x`, and `abs_y`.
}
\description{
This helper generates synthetic tracks radiating away from the origin. The
output is useful for examples, tests, and demonstrations that should not rely
on large raw tracking files bundled with the package. Each simulated trial is
assigned a stimulus direction (`stim_theta`) and a tortuosity level that
controls the angular noise around that direction.
}
\examples{
tracks <- simulate_tracks(n_trials = 3, n_points = 100, seed = 1)
head(tracks)
}
